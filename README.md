# LSDJ-SynthMod-GUI
Modification of Hertz Devils LSDJ Synth (https://github.com/HertzDevil/LSDjSynth) created in 2016 to support Deflemask .dmw and add a simple GUI.

Comprised of LSDJSynth mod command line tool and LSDJSynth GUI ("LSDJ Gui Test" in source) which is a windows forms app written in C# that calls LSDJSynth mod without needing to type out synth parameters.
